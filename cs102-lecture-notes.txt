Summary: In today's lecture we learned several new git related commands some of the are- git add, git commit, git push. Some other miscelleneous commands were also taught, a short descriptions of those are as follows-
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD or git branch --show-current: To know the current branch
git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all : For a better visualization of your repository with all commits and details
Other than this references were given for further studies if the learner is curious.
